After cloning the repository run the MakeFile and it should generate an executable to demonstrait the hashset. If you use the hashset please give me credit.

### Prerequisites

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```

```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests
